## Introduction
This study uses satellite imagery to analyze urban sustainability by assessing the balance between built-up areas and green spaces. It contributes to:
- **Goal 15** (Life on Land)
- **Goal 11** (Sustainable Cities and Communities)
- **Goal 13** (Climate Action)
- **Goal 3** (Good Health and Well-being)
- **Goal 17** (Partnerships for the Goals)

The research highlights urban green spaces' role in climate resilience, mitigating heat island effects, and improving well-being.

## Study Area: Surat City, Gujarat
Surat, also known as "The Silk City" and "The Diamond City," is a rapidly urbanizing commercial hub. Spanning **461.6 km¬≤** with **8 zones** and **134 wards**, the city has seen significant population growth. **Remote sensing** plays a crucial role in tracking land use changes and vegetation health, aiding sustainable development.

## Key Findings
### Land Cover Changes in Surat (2019-2023)
- **Built-up Areas:** Decreased from **40.97%** (2019) to **36.13%** (2023)
- **High Vegetation:** Increased from **2.83%** to **3.59%**
- **Moderate Vegetation:** Increased from **8.55%** to **9.72%**
- **Mild Vegetation:** Decreased from **17.42%** to **15.44%**
- **Light Vegetation:** Remained stable at **16.47%**

**Built-Up to Green Cover Ratio (2019-2023):**
- 2019: **16.15 times**
- 2020: **19.99 times**
- 2021: **21.14 times** (peak)
- 2022: **19.23 times**
- 2023: **20.64 times**

### Vegetation Elasticity in Tier 1 & 2 Cities
The impact of **1% increase** in built-up area varies:
- **Surat:** Mild vegetation sees the highest decline (-0.52%)
- **Ahmedabad:** Significant loss in light vegetation (-0.82%)
- **Mumbai & Bengaluru:** Light vegetation shows resilience (+0.58% and +0.32%)
- **Chandigarh:** Light vegetation increases (+0.3%)

### SDG Alignment
- **Goal 15**: Protecting terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity
- **Goal 11**: Promoting sustainable urban planning
- **Goal 13**: Enhancing climate resilience through green cover
- **Goal 3**: Improving public health via urban green spaces
- **Goal 17**: Encouraging partnerships for data-driven policies

## Policy Recommendations
- **Urban Greening**: Green roofs, urban parks, and vertical gardens
- **Ecosystem Protection**: Buffer zones and tree protection laws
- **Climate Resilience**: Green space integration in disaster planning
- **Public Health**: Linking green spaces with community well-being
- **Remote Sensing Utilization**: Data-driven urban planning

## Conclusion
To balance urban growth and sustainability, Surat must prioritize roadside vegetation, expand green initiatives, and protect mild vegetation. **Remote sensing** ensures precise monitoring, aiding informed decision-making for a greener future.
